# Data Structures and Algorithms â€“ Algomap Practice

This repository contains solutions to foundational DSA problems from [Algomap.io](https://algomap.io).  
These problems helped me develop core logic patterns important for machine learning and research in computer vision.

##  Problems Covered

- `find_closest_to_zero.py`: Find number closest to zero
- `roman_to_integer.py`: Convert Roman numerals to integers
- `is_subsequence.py`: Check if one string is a subsequence of another
- `merge_alternately.py`: Alternate merge two strings

Each file includes:
- A clean Python function
- Comments explaining the logic
- Test cases at the bottom


##  Next Steps

- Add a stack-based problem (Balanced Parentheses)
- Add a linked list problem (Reverse a Linked List)
- Explore sorting and recursion challenges
