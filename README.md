# Data Structures and Algorithms â€“ Algomap Practice

This repository contains solutions to foundational DSA problems I solved using [Algomap.io](https://algomap.io).  
These challenges were chosen to help build strong core logic patterns essential for machine learning and my research in computer vision.

##  Problems Completed

###  Arrays & Strings
- `find_closest_to_zero.py`: Find number closest to zero
- `roman_to_integer.py`: Convert Roman numerals to integers
- `is_subsequence.py`: Check if one string is a subsequence of another
- `merge_alternately.py`: Alternate merge two strings
- `product_except_self.py`: Return array of products except self (prefix/suffix logic)

###  Stacks
- `valid_parentheses.py`: Check for balanced parentheses using stack

###  Linked Lists
- `reverse_linked_list.py`: Reverse a singly linked list using pointer manipulation

##  File Structure

Each `.py` file includes:
- A clean, standalone Python function
- Clear inline comments explaining logic
- Simple test cases that can be run from the terminal
